<h1>Renovation <strong>highlights</strong></h1>
&nbsp;

Kennedy Libraryâ€™s renovation will include updated study spaces while maintaining the historic integrity of the exterior. The new space will incorporate additional gallery and showcasing spaces for students and faculty to share research and information in a visual way.

An operable greenhouse roof will be added, transforming the courtyard into flexible, year-round usable space. Multiple galleries and display spaces will exhibit student and faculty work and research. New electrical and mechanical systems will support sustainable thermal comfort.

<strong>Students will benefit from 15,000 square feet of recaptured space. More efficient space planning allows for:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>52% increase in user space</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Increase in seating from 2,400 to 3,500 seats</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>107 study rooms, a 65% increase</strong></li>
</ul>
Five additional classrooms will support active learning activities and programs. Services will be expanded to support student success in:
<ul>
 	<li>Data analysis and visualization</li>
 	<li>Development of cross-disciplinary research skills</li>
 	<li>Academic skills development that foster career readiness</li>
</ul>
