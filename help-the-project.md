Kennedy Library</h1>
<p>The need for a renovated library is great. Our students deserve a library that is modern, flexible and embodies the Learn by Doing spirit of Cal Poly. <strong>Your investment in Kennedy Library will touch every single student at Cal Poly. </strong></p>
<p>Transforming the beloved Kennedy Library into the Learn by Doing Library our campus deserves requires a minimum investment of $55 million.</p>
<p>The State of California has committed $50 million for this innovative campus improvement project. $5 million in private support is required to elevate the new building to the technologically rich and forward-looking resource this campus needs to stay on the forefront of Learn by Doing education.</p>
<p>Join us in making a lasting impact on every student, across all disciplines, at Cal Poly.</p>
