So far, I&#8217;m liking the new Osmo from DJI. This video was shot at 1080p, but the camera is capable of shooting in 2K and 4K. The lens is wide, but not as wide as my GoPro. The sound SUCKS, so an external mic is absolutely necessary if you&#8217;ll be capturing onsite sound. I&#8217;ve noticed what looks like shutter roll in some cases. There&#8217;s a noticeable wobble when walking normally, but I&#8217;m guessing that can be handled in post.
