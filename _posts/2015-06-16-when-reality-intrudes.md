Sometimes life sucks.

I&#8217;m probably still in shock. The macabre intrigue is this state of morbid research into what is likely the blueprint for my demise. I&#8217;ve become curious about the biology and science of my impending heart failure.

It&#8217;s become quite clear, even from the relatively little research I&#8217;ve done so far, that our current state of medicine is thoroughly broken and diseased. It&#8217;s driven by money and little else.

The harsh reality is that we all fall victim to an ultimate demise. Even if medicine manages to increase longevity to unimaginable lengths, the critical question may become a matter of &#8220;why?&#8221; It is an existential question in the end.

Life usually sucks for us all at some point or another. The beauty in life usually begins to appear when we experience the character and soul that emerges when reality intrudes.
