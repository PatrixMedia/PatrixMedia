I have a friend who is stuck because she cannot move on from plucking the same old feathers.

I have a lot of respect for her, but I cannot figure out how to help her move forward. I don&#8217;t know how to talk with her in a way that evolves from the same old bitter hurt she feels. I don&#8217;t know how to have a conversation with her that doesn&#8217;t involve her feminist rage.

Sometimes I feel she is indirectly attacking me.

Life is short. I will not likely choose to spend it plucking feathers&#8230;
