&#8220;I just don&#8217;t get the same energy and inspiration from women my own age.&#8221;

She looked at me, wanting to disagree, but realized I was probably speaking some form of truth. She is 6 years younger than my 54 years and recognized some uncomfortable truths in my descriptions of women in my proximate age group.

&#8220;They&#8217;re less energetic, less creative, whiny and often bitter.&#8221; I often feel much younger than my 54 years.

&#8220;You realize that women in your age-group are likely experiencing menopause, right?&#8221; She said this and then caught herself offering more of an excuse than an explanation.

&#8220;That may be true, but frankly I don&#8217;t care about the cause. I don&#8217;t want to spend time with women with that kind of energy. It does not inspire me, motivate me, or make me feel happy. Why would I choose any kind of relationship with a woman who makes me feel this way?&#8221;

She was stranded with the truth.

I love my sisters. I would never leave them stranded. &#8220;You are not representative of the women my age that I meet. You are happily married and are a model of a healthy marriage for me. If menopause causes you some disarray in your emotions, you are handling it well as far as I can see.&#8221; I looked her straight in the eyes so she could see that I was speaking from my heart.

&#8220;But I have spent time with women my age, and also with women who are many years younger. I have noticed a remarkable difference, and an affinity with the younger women.&#8221;

She smiled at me. &#8220;It&#8217;s true, you have a much younger and spirited soul than your age.&#8221;

Then she took my hand and looked into my eyes. &#8220;You should follow your instincts.&#8221;
